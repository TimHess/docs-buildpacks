title: Configuring Rake Tasks for deployed apps

For Cloud Foundry to automatically invoke a Rake task while a Ruby or Ruby on Rails app is deployed, you must do the following:

* Include the Rake task in your app
* Configure the application start command using the `command` attribute in the application manifest

Use the following example to invoke a Rake database migration task at application startup:

1. Create a file with the Rake task name and the extension `.rake`, and store it in the `lib/tasks` directory of your application.

1. Add the following code to your rake file:

    ```ruby
    namespace :cf do
        desc "Only run on the first application instance"
        task :on_first_instance do
            instance_index = JSON.parse(ENV["VCAP_APPLICATION"])["instance_index"] rescue nil
        exit(0) unless instance_index == 0
        end
    end
    ```

    This Rake task limits an idempotent command to the first instance of a deployed application.

1. Add the task to the `manifest.yml` file with the `command` attribute, referencing the idempotent command `rake db:migrate` chained with a start command.

    ```yaml
    applications:
    - name: my-rails-app
      command: bundle exec rake cf:on_first_instance db:migrate && rails s -p $PORT
    ```

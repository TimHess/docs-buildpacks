Buildpacks provide framework and runtime support for your app. Buildpacks typically examine your app to
determine what dependencies to download and how to start the application.

Since there are no system buildpacks yet for Cloud Native Buildpacks, you have to specify what buildpack to use, i.e. what type of application you have. 

Cloud Foundry deployments often have limited access to dependencies.
This limitation occurs when the deployment is behind a firewall, or when administrators want to use local mirrors and proxies. In these circumstances, Cloud Foundry provides a Buildpack Packager app. For more information, see the <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/buildpack-packager">Buildpack Packager</a> repository on GitHub.

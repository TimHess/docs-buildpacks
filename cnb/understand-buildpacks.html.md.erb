This topic tells you about how buildpacks are structured and detected in Cloud Foundry.

## <a id='buildpack-scripts'></a> Buildpack scripts

A buildpack repository might contain the following scripts in the `bin` directory:

* `bin/detect` determines whether or not to apply the buildpack to an app.
* `bin/build` is called if the buildpacks detect and builds the app including
  * downloading dependencies
  * actually building the app
  * defining the start command

You can use multiple buildpacks for your app

For example:

```
 <code>cf push APP-NAME --lifecycle cnb -b FIRST-BUILDPACK -b SECOND-BUILDPACK</code>
```

In this case <em>all</em> buildpacks must `detect` and `build` is called in the given order.

title: Using a Proxy Server
owner: Buildpacks

This topic describes how developers can use a proxy server with the buildpacks for their application.

##<a id='proxy-usage'></a> Use a Proxy

You can assign proxy servers to environment variables. Proxy servers can be used to monitor your application's traffic or to fetch your application's dependencies.

A buildpack uses a proxy server if that buildpack contacts the internet during staging.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The binary buildpack does not use a proxy server because it does not access the internet during staging.
</p>

##<a id='env-variable'></a> Setting environment variables

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you are using the Java buildpack, the <code>http_proxy</code> and <code>https_proxy</code> environment variables are not supported at runtime. The Java buildpack does not add the functionality to make proxies work at runtime.</p>

1. Add the following section to the `env` block of your application manifest YAML file:

    ```yaml
    ---
    env:
      http_proxy: http://YOUR-HTTP-PROXY:PORT
      https_proxy: https://YOUR-HTTPS-PROXY:PORT
    ```

    Where:
    <ul>
      <li><code>YOUR-HTTP-PROXY</code> is the address of your proxy server for HTTP requests.</li>
      <li><code>YOUR-HTTPS-PROXY</code> is the address of your proxy server for HTTPS requests.</li>
      <li><code>PORT</code> is the port number you are using for your proxy server.</li>
    </ul>

1. Set the environment variables with the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface's (cf CLI) `cf set-env` command
by running these commands:

    ```
    cf set-env YOUR-APP http_proxy "http://YOUR-HTTP-PROXY:PORT"
    ```
    ```
    cf set-env YOUR-APP https_proxy "https://YOUR-HTTPS-PROXY:PORT"
    ```

    Where:
    <ul>
      <li><code>YOUR-APP</code> is the name of your application.</li>
      <li><code>YOUR-HTTP-PROXY</code> is the address of your proxy server for HTTP requests.</li>
      <li><code>YOUR-HTTPS-PROXY</code> is the address of your proxy server for HTTPS requests.</li>
      <li><code>PORT</code> is the port number you are using for your proxy server.</li>
    </ul>

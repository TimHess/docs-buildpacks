Buildpacks provide framework and runtime support for your apps. Buildpacks typically examine your apps to
determine what dependencies to download and how to configure your apps to communicate with bound services.


In Cloud Foundry, you can use 2 types of buildpacks. [The Classic Buildpacks](./classic.html) (aka `v2`) and the
[Cloud Native Buildpacks](./cnb/) (aka `v3`).

[New Relic](http://newrelic.com/) collects analytics about your application and client side performance.

## <a id="configuration"></a> Configuration

You can configure New Relic for the PHP buildpack in one of two ways:

* License key
* Cloud Foundry service

### With a license key

Use this method if you already have a New Relic account. Use these steps:

1. In a web browser. go to the New Relic website to find your [license key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/license-key).

1. Set the value of the environment variable `NEWRELIC_LICENSE` to your New Relic license key, either through the [manifest.yml file](../../../devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html#env-block) or by running the `cf set-env` command.

### With a Cloud Foundry service

To configure New Relic for the PHP buildpack with a Cloud Foundry service, bind a New Relic service to the app.
The buildpack automatically detects and configures New Relic.

Your `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable must contain a service named `newrelic`, the `newrelic` service must contain a key named `credentials`, and the `credentials` key must contain named `licenseKey`.
